PROGRAM:
#1st Method
X = float(input("Enter the price of a dozen mangoes\n"))
Y = float(input("Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold\n"))
p = (12*Y)-X
if X == 12*Y:
    print("No profit nor loss")
elif 12*Y >= X:
    print(f"Profit : Rs.{'%.2f'%p}")
else:
    print(f"Loss : Rs.{'%.2f'%abs(p)}")


'''  
#2nd Method
X = float(input("Enter the price of a dozen mangoes\n"))
Y = float(input("Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold\n"))
p = ('%.2f'%((12*Y)-X))
l = ('%.2f'%(X-(12*Y)))
if X == 12*Y:
    print("No profit nor loss")
elif 12*Y >= X:
    print("Profit : Rs.{0}".format(p))
else:
    print("Loss : Rs.{0}".format(l))    # [you can also use abs(p) , which gives the positive value]
