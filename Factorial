# PROGRAM (Answer):

#1st Method
k = 1
n = int(input())
if n<=0:
    print("Invalid Input")  #here, you can also give print("no")
else:
    for i in range(n):
        if k==n:
            print("yes")
            break
        elif k<n:
            k = k*(i+1)
        else:
            print("no")
            break
        
#2nd Method
n = int(input())
k=1
count=1
p=1
while n>k:
    if p>0:
        k=k*count
        count=count+1
        p=p+1
    
else:
    if n==k:
        print("yes")
    else:
        print("no")
